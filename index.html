                    <h3>Advancing agroecology and nutrition through vegetable growing healthy food forests.</h3>
                    <p>While majority of the population are farmers, Kasese has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in Uganda, with more than 40% of children malnourished. Rising food prices after COVID-19 have only exacerbated the situation. To address this issue, Ndongo has trained 505 smallholder farmers in Mukunyu and Kitabu sub-counties to plant nutritious, quick-yielding vegetables like eggplants, tomatoes, onions, cabbages, and dodo (local amaranth) integrated with local fruit trees such as avocado, jackfruit, and mangoes</p>

                    <h3>Ground nuts and beans cultivation</h3>
                    <p>Ndongo provides training as well as ground nuts and bean seeds to smallholder farmers to reduce poverty and ensure that they always have a food basket at their home. The project provides high quality local seeds to farmers and then supports them to select, save, and store seeds for the next season. The farmers bring back enough seeds to Ndongo so that more farmers can benefit. This helps to reduce input costs, as many farmers cannot afford to both rent land and buy seeds. So far the project has served more than 90 households (540 individual farmers).</p>

                    <h3>Castor Oil Production</h3>
                    <p>: Castor production and processing is one of Ndonga’s primary projects. 
                        Ndongo has trained 150 farmers to grow castor organically and provides them with seeds. The farmers bring their castor harvest to Ndongo for sale. Ndongo purchases the castor seeds (thus ensuring that the farmers always have good market) and uses our oil press machine to process the castor seeds into safe, high-quality oil. Castor oil has an ample market in Uganda where it is often used in cosmetic and medicinal products.

                    <h3>Mushroom Cultivation</h3>
                    <p>This is an innovate project that Ndongo developed to take advantage of a market opportunity and improve both incomes and nutrition. Ndongo has constructed a mushroom growing center (with both dark and light rooms) and supported 485 women to cultivate sustainably oyster mushrooms, increasing their incomes by 75% and reducing malnutrition by 30% among their families.</p>

                    <p>Herbal medicine has been one of Ndongo’s foundation programs after realizing that the Rwenzori region is blessed with indigenous plants that can improve health. As many people cannot afford either public or private healthcare in these areas, Ndongo United provides an affordable alternative for simple ailments.</p>

The mission of the network is to conserve, promote, and share indigenous seeds throughout the Albertine region by identifying endangered/scarce varieties</p>
